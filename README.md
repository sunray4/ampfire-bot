This discord bot was programmed using Node.js for the shad mta '24 discord server. It is capable of moderating fiducial (an attendance game we played during Shad), requesting and remembering the birthdays of server members, and reminding the discord community to celebrate these birthdays. The project is deployed on Render to keep the bot active 24-7.
